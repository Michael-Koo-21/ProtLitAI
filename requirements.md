# Requirements Document: Protein Design Literature Intelligence Engine (ProtLitAI)

## Project Overview
**Project Name:** Protein Design Literature Intelligence Engine (ProtLitAI)  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** July 18, 2025  
**Stakeholders:** Xaira Research Team, Bioinformatics Group, Strategic Planning Team

### Executive Summary
ProtLitAI is a comprehensive AI-powered system designed to revolutionize how Xaira's research team stays current with protein design literature. The system automatically monitors, extracts, and synthesizes research from all major scientific databases, providing real-time intelligence on field developments, competitive analysis, and strategic research opportunities. By leveraging advanced NLP and semantic analysis, ProtLitAI transforms information overload into actionable insights, enabling faster decision-making and identification of emerging research directions.

### Problem Statement
The protein design field is experiencing exponential growth in publications, with thousands of papers published monthly across multiple platforms (PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, patents). Xaira's research team currently faces several critical challenges:
- **Information Overload**: Manual literature monitoring is becoming impossible at current publication rates
- **Fragmented Sources**: Important research is scattered across different databases and platforms
- **Time Lag**: Critical insights are discovered weeks or months after publication
- **Competitive Blindness**: Lack of systematic competitive intelligence gathering
- **Research Gaps**: Difficulty identifying underexplored areas with strategic potential

**Target Audience:** Xaira research scientists, strategy team, competitive intelligence analysts  
**Expected Outcomes:** 80% reduction in literature review time, real-time competitive awareness, proactive identification of research opportunities
